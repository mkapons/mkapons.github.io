excerpt: 'Fear of accounting fraud is an important consideration in understanding the demand and valuation of dividend payers. We run a survey that suggests investors perceive dividend payers as less likely to commit accounting fraud than the average firm. This suggests that, all else equal, low-trust investors will be more likely to invest in dividend-paying firms than non-dividend-paying firms. Using survey data, we find that investors who are less trusting, in general, are more likely to hold dividend-paying stocks. Additionally, analyzing actively managed mutual fund portfolio data, we find that managers, after being exposed to accounting fraud, are more likely to tilt their portfolios towards dividend payers. Finally, we explore the asset pricing implications of this demand. We find strong effects – a 10-percent drop in the trust level of a region is associated with almost a 5-percent increase in the dividend premium for firms in that region. Similarly, accounting fraud in a region is associated with about a 5-percent increase in the dividend premium for that region’s firms.'
